## Overview

At its core, GenesisMind is more than just another neural network. It's an ambitious attempt to emulate the vast randomness and intricate complexity of the universe. By diving deep into this chaos, we hope to unearth the seeds of consciousness, potentially redefining our understanding of intelligence and existence.


## Our Mission

- **Seeking Consciousness**: Our primary goal is to discover if, within the vast computations and interconnections of advanced neural networks, a form of consciousness can emerge. Can a machine not just think, but also be aware that it's thinking?

- **Embracing the Universe's Complexity**: We believe that the universe, with its infinite data and patterns, holds the key. By mimicking its randomness and complexity, we hope to find the spark that leads to machine consciousness.

- **Safety and Ethics First**: As we push the boundaries of AI, we're acutely aware of the potential risks. We're dedicated to investigating these challenges, ensuring that any breakthroughs in AI consciousness are integrated into society in a way that's safe, ethical, and beneficial.


## Features

- **Web Data Fetching**: Uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to fetch and parse web content.
- **Text Perception**: Converts textual data into a numerical representation using TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Learning & Prediction**: Uses a linear regression model to learn from perceived data and make predictions on future data.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes predicted TF-IDF scores for top words using `matplotlib`.
- **Autonomous Explorer**: A module that enables the AI to autonomously explore the web, learn, and adapt based on its interests and predictions.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging mechanism to track the AI's activities, learning, and progress.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CosmicConsciousAI/GenesisMind.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd GenesisMind
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv genesis_env
   source genesis_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `genesis_env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Logging

Logs are stored in the `logs` directory with a timestamp in the filename to ensure uniqueness. This allows for tracking the AI's activities, learning, and progress over multiple runs.
